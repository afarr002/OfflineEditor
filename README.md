## Description

Let me set the scene, you're away from your office, on a nice (well deserved) vacation, when all of the sudden, you figure out exactly what logic you need in your function call to the database. You can't forget, this is way too important, but you cannot update your code from Hawaii. This is where my offline text editor comes in handy. Just type your code in, click the blue bar on the top of the screen, and your data will be saved in two different locations to ensure it will be there when you return. "But Aaron", you say, "how can I access your application when I am away from my office?" This gave me the opportunity to work with PWA technology. So you just hit the "Install" button, and you can install the application directly on your tablet or mobile device! So rest assured knowing that no matter where you go, you have access to a editor specific for your JS code!
